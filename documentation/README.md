# The Hacksaw Docs

The "hacksaw" is a weak diagnostic tool: it helps with finding the symptoms, but not the cause. Using a hacksaw too liberally may have unpleasant results, precaution is advised.

This tool is not planned as a large project, as such the documentation will mostly be focused toward some general use cases.
